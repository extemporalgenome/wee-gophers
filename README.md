# Wee Gophers

This is a reworking of the wee gophers found tunneling through various parts of
the [golang.org](http://golang.org) site. These (or at least the original
gopher design) were made by Renée French.

In particular, they've been given transparent backgrounds and a soft glow
outline. Superimposed upon white backgrounds, these should look roughly
identical to the originals.
